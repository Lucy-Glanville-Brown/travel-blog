# Wunderlust Travel Blog

## Portfolio Project 4 - Code Institute

Wunderlust is a travel blog and community where anyone who loves to travel can view and share their travel stories. The content of the posts are based on places I have been lucky enough to visit and I wanted to include some of my highlights to draw the users in.

#### Colours

[Adobe Color Extract Theme]('https://color.adobe.com/create/image')

The colours were chosen by using Adobe Color Extract Theme from an image of Whitsunday Island I found on Pixabay.

[Contrast Grid - Eightshapes.com]('https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp')

Once the colours were chosen I used a contrast checker to decide which colour worked best for the Navbar and Footer with white text.

[MyColor.Space]('https://mycolor.space/')

I also used colorspace to search for other shades that worked well with the Navbar/Footer colour #07668C and decided to use colour #A2E5FF for the main body background colour.
