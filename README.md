# Wunderlust Travel Blog

## Portfolio Project 4 - Code Institute

Wunderlust is a travel blog and community where anyone who loves to travel can view and share their travel stories. The content of the posts are based on places I have been lucky enough to visit and I wanted to include some of my highlights to draw the users in.
