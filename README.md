# Wunderlust Travel Blog

## Portfolio Project 4 - Code Institute

Wunderlust is a travel blog and community where anyone who loves to travel can view and share their travel stories. The content of the posts are based on places I have been lucky enough to visit and I wanted to include some of my highlights to draw the users in.

#### Colours

[Adobe Color Extract Theme]('https://color.adobe.com/create/image')

The colours were chosen by using Adobe Color Extract Theme from an image of Whitsunday Island I found on Pixabay.

![adobe_color_theme_11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85178695/160018401-68c53e47-940d-45bf-9bea-5e14c31f8d76.png)

[Contrast Grid - Eightshapes.com]('https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp')

Once the colours were chosen I used a contrast checker to decide which colour worked best for the Navbar and Footer with white text.

![color_theme_11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85178695/160018447-fc0ad0c6-2f5c-4bd4-bf0a-125d547f998b.png)

[MyColor.Space]('https://mycolor.space/')

I also used colorspace to search for other shades that worked well with the Navbar/Footer colour #07668C and decided to use colour #A2E5FF for the main body background colour.

## Deployment

### Deploying on Heroku

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

### Forking the Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

* Log into GitHub or create an account.
* Locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork"
* You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Creating a Clone

How to run this project locally:

* Install the GitPod Browser Extension for Chrome.
* After installation, restart the browser.
* Log into GitHub or create an account.
* Locate the GitHub Repository.
* Click the green "GitPod" button in the top right corner of the repository. This will trigger a new gitPod workspace to be created from the code in github where you can work locally.
