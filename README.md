# Wunderlust Travel Blog

## Portfolio Project 4 - Code Institute

Wunderlust is a travel blog and community where anyone who loves to travel can view and share their travel stories. The content of the posts are based on places I have been lucky enough to visit and I wanted to include some of my highlights to draw the users in.

I used GitHub Projects to create a Kanban board to manage the planning and implementation of the functionality I wanted to include in this project. Click [here]('https://github.com/Lucy-Glanville-Brown/travel-blog/projects?type=beta') to see my project board.

![Travel Blog Kanban Board](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85178695/160198378-e2020da0-b249-4bdf-9bd8-fd35fdafbe39.png)

### Strategy

I wanted to create a platform where users can share their travel stories and is aimed at anyone who has a love of travel. 
* People who have been travelling
* People looking to go travelling
* Anyone with a love of travel

### Scope

For the users I wanted to provide them with easy naviagation and a brief introduction to the site and eye catching images for the posts. The site has responsive design so should function correctly across various devices such as, Mobiles, Tablet, Laptop and Desktop.

### Structure

This site has been designed with simplicity in mind, each page only has key information on it so that the user can find what they want quickly. 

### Skeleton
The wire frames were created using Balsamiq.

#### Colours

[Adobe Color Extract Theme]('https://color.adobe.com/create/image')

The colours were chosen by using Adobe Color Extract Theme from an image of Whitsunday Island I found on Pixabay.

![adobe_color_theme_11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85178695/160018401-68c53e47-940d-45bf-9bea-5e14c31f8d76.png)

[Contrast Grid - Eightshapes.com]('https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp')

Once the colours were chosen I used a contrast checker to decide which colour worked best for the Navbar and Footer with white text.

![color_theme_11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85178695/160018447-fc0ad0c6-2f5c-4bd4-bf0a-125d547f998b.png)

[MyColor.Space]('https://mycolor.space/')

I also used colorspace to search for other shades that worked well with the Navbar/Footer colour #07668C and decided to use colour #A2E5FF for the main body background colour.

![color_space_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85178695/160018530-090d5379-aa9c-4c5c-a7cf-f7204f86153e.png)


#### Typography

I decided to use ‘Pacifico’ for the Wunderlust branding and ‘Roboto’ and sans-serif for the remaining text.

### Bugs

* When the user submits a comment and the page reloads you have to scroll down to see the message "Your comment is awaiting approval"

* When the user edits a post the bootstrap class properties appear in the content box, this has also been flagged in the HTML validator testing for the post_detail page

### Validator Testing

* W3C Markup Validation

I have tested the home, register, login, sign out, new post, edit post and delete post pages with no errors returned. 

![html](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85178695/160198004-944c0af7-565b-4b76-987a-c9026e0ebbd5.png)

The post_detail page has an error relating to the bootstrap class card-text, which is also causing a bug in the edit post page

![html_post_detail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85178695/160198055-4e108688-70c4-44ff-ba9c-b0272e5fc9ec.png)
